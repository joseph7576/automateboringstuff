'''
Write a program to invert the row and column of the cells in the spreadsheet. 
For example, the value at row 5, column 3 will be at row 3, column 5 (and vice versa). 
This should be done for all cells in the spreadsheet. 

You can write this program by using nested for loops to read the spreadsheetâ€™s data into 
a list of lists data structure. This data structure could have sheetData[x][y] for the cell at column x and row y. 
Then, when writing out the new spreadsheet, use sheetData[y][x] for the cell at column x and row y.
